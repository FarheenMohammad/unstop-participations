The Case Masters: Industry Solution Summit was a national-level case study competition organized by the Department of Management Studies (DoMS), IIT Madras, as part of EMBARK 2025. In collaboration with CavinKare, the challenge invited participants to analyze real-world business problems and propose strategic, actionable solutions. The competition comprised two rounds:

Round 1: Executive Summary Submission – Participants analyzed an industry case and submitted a strategic solution addressing key problem areas, including market expansion, product differentiation, go-to-market strategy, and brand positioning for CavinKare’s dairy beverage portfolio.

I successfully submitted my Round 1 executive summary and am awaiting the shortlisting results for the campus finale.
